# My React Base
This repository is made with the goal of building a <b>React JS</b> asset. Which shall contain, all the fundamental building blocks towards frontend development using <b>React JS</b>, such that it can be referred later during any kind of frontend development.

# Asset Structure
Each folder in this repo is a small isolated `react-app` and considered as an example of fundamental building blocks.

# How to work in this repo?
Since each folder in this repo is a small `react-app`, hence we can get started with the following command
```bash
npx create-react-app < folder-name >
```
### Points to note
- Remove `.git` folder in the newly created `react-app` as `my-react-base` is the parent <i>git</i> repository.

## How to develop one example?
- After creating the `react-app` start developing in the folder.
- In `App.js` or `App.jsx` write the proper description in the comment using the following template at the very begining. 
    ```jsx
    /**
     * @description - Description of the example.
     * @author - Name [email (optional)]
     */
    ```
